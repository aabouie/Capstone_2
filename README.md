The dataset includes Airbnb availble units, locations, availability data, etc.



## Web Scraping
In this project, I scraped the Airbnb website to get the details of all available units in Austin, TX area. It's worth to mention that the units URLs were obtained from the available records on Insideairbnb.com website. After scraping the Airbnb website, the details of 10272 units with more than 80 features were obtained. You can find the scraping code in the following directory: SRC/Airbnb_Scraping.ipynb


## EDA Analysis











### Features
Features are chosen only if they were informative and are likely to correlated with the price label. Therefore, I eliminated features like id, host_id, neighborhood description which did not have an impact on the listing price. In addition, I removed some of the other features such as longitude and lagitutude as I was mainly using zipcode as the feature.
