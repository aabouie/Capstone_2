The dataset includes Airbnb availble units, locations, availability data, etc.


### Features
Features are chosen only if they ware informative and are likely to correlated with the price label. Therefore, I eliminated features like id, host_id, which appear to be noise. In addition, I removed some of the other features such as longitude and lagitutude.
