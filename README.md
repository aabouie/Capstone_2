## Proposal 1





## Proposal 2




## Proposal 3
20 % of the total oil production in US is coming from the Bakken asset with more than 20,000 wells. The economy of the field development depends on the total oil production from each well. So, it would be really importnat to have an estimate of oil production for each well. That target depends on so many factors such as geology, drilling, completion, and production scenarios. 
In this proposal, we are going to use the data from 22,000 wells in North Dakota and use ML algoritm to have a comprehensive model to predict the oil production from the future wells.
The data is extracted from DrillingInfo Website and North Dakota public data. The total number of features is more than 100.
