# Capstone_2

Please see the items below for second capstone propsal project:

## Proposal 1: Marketing Data
Machine learning algorithms is going to be applied to web search ranking. The dataset consits of features extracted from query,url) pairs along with relavance judgments. The features names have been removed in the origiran dataset. So feature engineering would be random for this project.


## Proposal 2: Watch prices
In this work, the data for some of used brand watches is going to be used to predict the watch price. There are more than 10 features that can be considered to build a model for predictive watch price.
The data is obtained by web scraping several websites.


## Proposal 3: Prediction of Oil Production from Each Well to Optimize Field Development Scenarios
20 % of the total oil production in US is coming from the Bakken asset with more than 20,000 wells. The economy of the field development depends on the total oil production from each well. So, it would be really importnat to have an estimate of oil production for each well. That target depends on so many factors such as geology, drilling, completion, and production scenarios. 
In this proposal, we are going to use the data from 22,000 wells in North Dakota and use ML algoritm to have a comprehensive model to predict the oil production from the future wells.
The data is extracted from DrillingInfo Website and North Dakota public data. The total number of features is more than 100.


## Proposal 4: Airbnb Austin Price Prediction
The dataset includes the Airbnb homes/apartments/location/timing,etc. Different Machine learning algorithm can be used to predict the pricing for Airbnb apartments based on the features.


## Proposal 5: The Cancer Genome Atlas
The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), a collaboration between the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), aims to generate comprehensive, multi-dimensional maps of the key genomic changes in major types and subtypes of cancer. 
TCGA has analyzed matched tumor and normal tissues from 11,000 patients, allowing for the comprehensive characterization of 33 cancer types and subtypes, including 10 rare cancers. The dataset contains open Clinical Supplement, Biospecimen Supplement, RNA-Seq Gene Expression Quantification, miRNA-Seq Isoform Expression Quantification, miRNA Expression Quantification, Genotyping Array Copy Number Segment, Genotyping Array Masked Copy Number Segment, Genotyping Array Gene Level Copy Number Scores, WXS Masked Somatic Mutation, Methylation Array Methylation Beta Value Tissue Slide Image, and Diagnostic Slide Image data from Genomic Data Commons (GDC).

The data is located in AWS (https://registry.opendata.aws/tcga/)

## Proposal 6: Phishing Email Detection
The dataset from UCI Machine Learning repository is going to be used to detect phishing emails. The dataset includes 11055 datapoints with 4900 phishing Urls. The dataset has more than 20 features.
