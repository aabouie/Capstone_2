# Project: Predicting Airbnb Listing Price in Austin, TX

![](img/Austin_Airbnb.JPG)

Airbnb is an online marketplace that connects people who want to rent out their homes with people who are looking for accomodations in that area. Airbnb currently covers more than 100,000 cities and 220 countries worldwide. The company's name comes from "Air Mattress B&B".






This projects aims to solve this problem, by using machine learning to predict the base price of available units in Austin. In the following section, I'm going to describe the exploratory data analysis, followed by building different models to predict Airbnb prices.


## Web Scraping
In this project, I scraped the Airbnb website to get the details of all available units in Austin, TX area. It's worth to mention that the units URLs were obtained from the available records on Insideairbnb.com website. Then, Selenium and BeautifulSoup were used to scrape the required data from each Url, followed by storing the data in Mongo database.
After scraping the Airbnb website, the details of 10272 units with more than 80 features were obtained. You can find the scraping code in the following directory: SRC/Airbnb_Scraping.ipynb

## EDA Analysis




According to data from Beyond Pricing, someone with a FLAT pricing plan can stand to gain as much as 43% on revenues.  Even very experienced hosts who keep diligent market data and track competitive pricing regularly can expect to gain at least 10% to their revenues.

It’s not easy to price your Airbnb unit on your own and it takes up quite a bit of time and effort that you might not have.

Having a partner like Beyond Pricing that can automatically track all the relevant data for you and adjust your pricing optimally to get you more profits is worth considering if you want more bookings during low season and higher booking rates during high season.


Many Airbnb hosts, particularly new and less experienced ones, will set a baseline price for their unit and then just forget about it.  This is a perfect way to miss out on bookings and leave profits on the table.

Let’s look the example below with three different hosts, each holding a flat pricing throughout the year.



### Features
Features are chosen only if they were informative and are likely to correlated with the price label. Therefore, I eliminated features like id, host_id, neighborhood description which did not have an impact on the listing price. In addition, I removed some of the other features such as longitude and lagitutude as I was mainly using zipcode as the feature.

* Label


* Continous features



* Categorical features:


* Text features:


* Date features: 


Final Features that were included in the model are:
* host_is_superhost
* host_listings_count
* host_total_listings_count
* Accommodates
* Number of bedrooms
* Number of beds
* Number of bathrooms
* Minimum number of nights of reservation
* Maximum number of nights of reservation
* Availability of the unit in the next 90 days
* Total number of reviews
* Total number of reviews over the last 30 days
* Whether the unit is instantly bookable or not
* How long the host has joined Airbnb
* Whether the availble room is private or shared
* Whether the entire house is available or not
* Cleanliness score
* Accuracy score
* Communication score
* Checkin score
* Value score
* Available Amenities:
    * Pool 
    * TV 
    * Washer 
    * Dryer
    * Balcony
    * Private entrance
    * BBQ grill
    * Hot tub
* Single level home
* Five areas in Austin with the following zip codes:
    * 78702
    * 78703
    * 78704
    * 78734
    * 78746


The following figure shows the correlation heat map for some of the important features in the dataset. As can be seen, number of beds, bedrooms, bathrooms, and accomodates have relatively high positive impact on the Airbnb listing price.
